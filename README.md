# Kathmandu Bus Route Map — Zoomable Tile Viewer

A high-performance, pannable, and zoomable static web viewer for the vector Kathmandu transit map designed by Subham Subedi. Built with **React 19**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, **Vite**, and **Leaflet.js (`L.CRS.Simple`)**, with an optimized Deep Zoom tile pyramid generated via a Python toolchain (`PyMuPDF` + `Pillow`).

## 🗺️ Map & Tile Pipeline Specifications

### 1. Source Vector PDF
- **Source File**: `Kathmandu-Bus-Route-Map-by-Subham-Subedi (4).pdf`
- **Native Dimensions**: 2800 × 2100 points (~38.89 × 29.17 inches)
- **Cartographer**: Subham Subedi

### 2. Rasterization & DPI Calculation
To ensure crystal-clear vector text and bus route numbers down to the smallest label, the PDF is rasterized at **6× scale (432 DPI)**:
$$\text{Width} = 2800 \times 6 = 16,800\text{ px}$$
$$\text{Height} = 2100 \times 6 = 12,600\text{ px}$$
$$\text{DPI} = 6 \times 72 = 432\text{ DPI}$$

### 3. Deep Zoom Tile Pyramid
- **Format**: `tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`
- **Tile Size**: 256 × 256 px
- **Zoom Levels**: 0 (overview) to 6 (full 1:1 needle-sharp vector detail)
- **Total Tiles**: 4,437 tiles across 7 zoom levels
- **Storage Size**: ~14.3 MB (optimized web-compressed PNGs with adaptive canvas background padding)

## 🚀 Tile Regeneration Guide

If the source PDF is updated, you can regenerate the entire tile pyramid with the included Python toolchain:

### Step 1: Initialize Python Environment
```powershell
# Create local virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Install required pip packages
.\.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install pymupdf pillow tqdm
```

### Step 2: Rasterize High-Resolution Master Image
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python scripts/rasterize.py
```
*Outputs `master.png` (16,800 × 12,600 px) in ~6 seconds.*

### Step 3: Slice Deep Zoom Tile Pyramid
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python scripts/generate_tiles.py
```
*Generates all zoom levels (0 to 6) in `public/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png` in ~5 seconds.*

*(Equivalent `libvips` command if libvips is installed: `vips dzsave master.png public/tiles --layout google --suffix .png`)*

> **Note**: `master.png` is an intermediate file (~8 MB) and is excluded from git via `.gitignore`. Only the final tiles and source PDF are tracked in version control.

## 💻 Frontend Development & Build

### Development Server
```bash
# Install npm dependencies
npm install

# Start local dev server
npm run dev
```

### Production Static Build
```bash
npm run build
```
Builds the static production bundle into `dist/` with relative subpath asset paths (`base: './'`), ready for deployment.

### Preview Production Build
```bash
npm run preview
```

## 📴 Offline, Installable App & Shareable Links

### Offline (service worker)
- `src/service-worker.js` is a template. At build time the `ktm-offline` plugin in `vite.config.js` fills in the hashed bundle file list and emits `dist/sw.js` and `dist/tiles-manifest.json`. The service worker only registers in production builds (`npm run build && npm run preview` to test it).
- On install it precaches the app shell, the route SVG and tile zoom levels 0–3 (~1.5 MB). Every tile the user views after that is cached as they browse.
- The **Save map offline** button (cloud icon) downloads the full tile pyramid (~18 MB) into the same cache, so every zoom level works without data. The download can resume, skips tiles already cached, and asks the browser for persistent storage.
- Cache names include a content hash: regenerating tiles or changing the build automatically replaces old caches.

### Installable app (PWA)
- `public/manifest.webmanifest` and `public/icons/` make the site installable (standalone window, home-screen icon). Regenerate the icons with `python scripts/generate_app_icons.py`.
- The offline panel shows **Install as app** when the browser offers it (Chrome/Edge/Android), and an *Add to Home Screen* hint on iOS.

### Shareable links
The selected operator, route branches and pinned place are kept in the URL, so the share button (or the address bar) gives a link that reopens the same view:

| Param | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `op` | Operator code from `legendData.js` | `op=S` (Sajha Yatayat) |
| `r` | Comma-separated branch codes from `dedicatedRoutesData.js` | `r=S1,S2` |
| `p` | Place name from `placesData.js` | `p=Lagankhel` |
| `from` | Trip planner: starting stop name | `from=Jawalakhel` |
| `to` | Trip planner: destination stop name | `to=Ratnapark` |
| `opt` | Trip planner: chosen option, counted from 1 (left out for the first) | `opt=2` |

Examples: `/?op=S&r=S2&p=Lagankhel` (a route), `/?from=Jawalakhel&to=Ratnapark&opt=2` (a trip, which opens the planner). A trip planned from your location shares the stop you board at, never your coordinates. Unknown values are ignored. See `src/shareLink.js`.

---

## 🧭 Trip Planner (GPS → nearest stop → buses)

**Stop search** (top left of the map): type a stop name and pick a result. The map flies to the stop, and a card lists the buses that stop there; tap a bus to highlight its route. **Directions from here / to here** opens the planner with that stop filled in.

The **Find your bus** button (navigation arrow) opens a planner:

1. **From**: a stop you search for. Or tap the location button inside the field: only then does the browser ask for your location, and your position is matched to the nearest stops by real walking distance.
2. **To**: any stop on the map.
3. **Options**: up to four trips, fastest first, each listing the walk to the stop, the bus to board and the direction sign to look for ("towards RNAC"; ring-road buses show the next stop instead), the number of stops, where to get off, and any changes. Trips needing two or more buses are found too: routing is a Dijkstra search over (stop, bus) states with a transfer penalty, so it is not limited to direct buses.

The selected trip highlights its buses on the map and pins where to board, change and get off. Your position shows as a blue dot. The dot is approximate, because the map is a schematic: distances are not to scale, and the centre is magnified.

Planning runs entirely in the browser (the planner chunk loads on first open, and the service worker caches it), so it works offline.

### Network data: `src/data/tripNetwork.js`

Generated by `scripts/build_trip_network.py` (needs `numpy` and `svgelements`):

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install numpy svgelements
.\.venv\Scripts\python scripts/build_trip_network.py            # uses the cached OSM download
.\.venv\Scripts\python scripts/build_trip_network.py --refresh-osm
```

- **Stations**: stop dots in the SVG are clustered (parallel lines at one stop form one station) and paired with their labels.
- **Lines**: each branch geometry (the `svgId` values in `dedicatedRoutesData.js`, or the operator group when an operator has no branches) is sampled. Stations sitting on it are linked by walking the geometry, so lines that branch or loop route correctly.
- **Coordinates**: station names are matched to named OpenStreetMap features (fetched once from the Overpass API and cached in `routes_data/osm_named_features.json`, which is gitignored). Repeated names are told apart with a local, distortion-aware fit. About 275 of 730 stations get exact OSM coordinates. The rest are interpolated from nearby matches, with a median error of roughly 300 m, so walking distances to those stops are estimates.

Re-run the script whenever the SVG or the route definitions change.

## 🌐 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Kathmandu bus route zoomable tile viewer"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
1. Go to your **Cloudflare Dashboard** → **Workers & Pages** → **Create application** → **Pages**.
2. Connect your GitHub repository.
3. In Build settings:
   - **Framework preset**: `Vite`
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Build output directory**: `dist`
4. Click **Save and Deploy**.

### 3. Deploy to GitHub Pages (Alternative)
- Go to repository **Settings** → **Pages**.
- Select **Deploy from a branch** → Branch: `main` / Folder: `/dist` (or use GitHub Actions static pages deployment).
- Because `base: './'` is configured in `vite.config.js`, all tiles and assets resolve properly on subpaths (`username.github.io/repo/`).
